**Enclosure**:

- [OAK-D Pro PoE STP](https://oak-files.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/OAK-D-Pro-POE/NG9097Pro_enclosure.stp)
- [OAK-D Pro W PoE STP](https://oak-files.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/OAK-D-Pro-POE/NG9097ProW_enclosure.stp)
- [STL Enclosure for both variants](https://oak-files.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/OAK-D-Pro-POE/NG9097.STL)

**PCBA**
- [STEP PCBA file for both variants](https://oak-files.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/OAK-D-Pro-POE/NG9097Pro_PCBA.STEP)

OAK-D Pro PoE and OAK-D Pro W PoE are almost identical, except different CCMs and a larger camera hole in the front of the enclosure,
that's why the PCBA and STL files are the same for both versions.
