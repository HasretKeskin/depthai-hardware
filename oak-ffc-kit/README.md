# OAK-FFC-Kit

[Documentation here](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/ffc-cameras.html#ffc-camera-mounting).

Below are the FFC adapters, to which you can attach [FFC camera modules](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/ffc-cameras.html), and attach the adapter to the 20x20 T-Slot aluminum framing. We recommend
buying the [OAK-FFC-Kit on our shop](https://shop.luxonis.com/collections/early-access/products/oak-ffc-kit), but you can also buy all the screws and profiles, and 3D-print the adapters, as they are open source (see below).


### Step files

Use M5 screws to attached these adapters to the ALU profile.

- [OAK-FFC-4P-adapter.STL](3D_Models/OAK-FFC-4P-adapter.STL) - To attach [OAK-FFC-4P](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DD2090.html) to the ALU profile using M2.5 screws. Note that this adapter is not suitable for FFC-3P / FFC-6P!
- [Arducam-FFC-camera-adapter.STL](3D_Models/Arducam-FFC-camera-adapter.STL) - For Arducam and RaspberryPi (HQ, GS) camera modules, which have a size of  38x38 mm. Camera modules can be attached to the adapter with M2.5 screws.
- [FFC-camera-adapter-horizontal.STL](3D_Models/FFC-camera-adapter-horizontal.STL) - For OAK FFC and RaspberryPi (v1, v2, 3, 3 Wide) camera modules, which have a size of 25x24 mm. Use this adapter to position the camera parallel to the aluminum framing. Camera modules can be attached to the adapter with M2 screws.
- [FFC-camera-adapter-vertical.STL](3D_Models/FFC-camera-adapter-vertical.STL) - For OAK FFC and RaspberryPi (v1, v2, 3, 3 Wide) camera modules, which have a size of 25x24 mm. Use this adapter to position the camera perpendicular to the aluminum framing. Camera modules can be attached to the adapter with M2 screws.
