## BW1098OBC-USBC

### Progress : 

This schematic passes electrical rules check and is true to the original Luxonis BW1098OBC-USBC reference schematic. The PCB has not been laid out, however most uncommon footprints have been checked and mapped. This is a good starting point for a custom design that is similar to the BW1098OBC with on-board CCMs (harder to source than arducam modules, but cheaper). Arducam has comparable cameras that could easily replace those in this design but make sure you check the pinout, we are still working on standardizing our connector layout with arducam.
