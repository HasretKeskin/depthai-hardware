Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC-4P** (DD2090FFC) baseboard has **4 FFC interfaces** which allows for:

- **Two 2-lane MIPI** camera modules, eg. :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` (stereo pair)
- **Two 4-lane MIPI** camera modules, eg. :ref:`OAK-FFC-IMX378 <bg0249>` RGB camera module, or additional :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` if RGB camera module is not required

Please note that only revision R1M1E1 and newer camera modules can be connected to this OAK FFC board.

To see **which cameras are compatible with this OAK FFC baseboard**, see the guide here: :ref:`OAK FFC camera modules`.
Some of camera modules have a :ref:`M12 mount <M12 mount lenses>`, so you can use different lenses to get **custom FoV** (with :ref:`wide or narrow FOV M12 lenses <M12 selectable FOV>`).

This board uses :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro` and is also compatible with RPi camera interface. For that you will need a `FFC from Arducam <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-12mp-imx477-mini-high-quality-camera-with-m12-mount-lens-and-adapter-board-for-depthai/>`__,
which converts 26-pin Luxonis camera pinout to 22 pin RPi camera pinout.

In addition, IMU (over SPI) sensor is also added to this OAK FFC board.

Getting started
***************

The OAK-FFC-4P is powered via USB Type-C or from a 5V, 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack, and interfaces to a host via USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C. With cameras and the
:ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro`, total power consumption usually stays below the 900ma specification of USB 3, but Type-C power of 1.5A or greater is recommended.

Interfacing with the OAK-SoM-Pro is also possible with OAK-FFC-4P connector pads J3, J4, and J5. These pads are designed for the Amphenol/FCI
20021121-00010T1LF or equivalent. Please refer to the schematics for pinout information.

The reset button resets the OAK-SoM-Pro only. The boot button overrides boot mode to USB boot if different boot mode is set on
the NOR Flash.

The 5V LED indicates 5V power is present on the board. The PG LED indicates "power good" from the OAK-SoM-Pro. The "RUN" LED indicates that the 
OAK-SoM-Pro is not in reset.

FFC cables
**********

For FFC cables we use `Molex series 15166 <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/partSearch?query=15166>`__. Along with the OAK FFC board, we ship
**26 pin count, same-sided, 152mm** cables (part number `151660281 <https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/cable/0151660281>`__).
If you would like to use **shorter/longer FFC cables**, you can get them `here <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/deepSearch?pQuery=q%253D*%253A*%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dproductseries%253A%252215166%2522%252BOR%252Bengineeringnumber%253A%252215166%2522%2540fq%253Dcategory%253A%2522Cable%2522%2540fq%253Dcircuitsloaded%253A%252226%2522&currentQuery=contactlayouttype%3AA%2B%2528same%2Bside%2529&origin=_l1stv13w>`__.
