AI Power Consumption
********************

RVC4's AI system is designed to be power-efficient and configurable to the user's needs. The AI system can be configured to run at different power levels, which will affect the performance of the AI system.
The following table shows the power consumption of the AI system at different power levels:

Power measurements were taken of the whole RVC4 board during 10 second inference runs. So the AI power consumption is a bit less, as the rest of the chip (mainly CPU) is also consuming power.

Custom applications
-------------------

Users will have full access to the power of the RVC4:

- Easy development & deployment of **custom containerized apps** will be possible out-of-the-box via `RobotHub <https://www.luxonis.com/robothub>`__
- Develop and run fast CV pipelines on top of accelerated hardware blocks using `Halide <https://halide-lang.org/>`__
- Interface with GPIOs and communication interfaces

..
    - Full access to the **Linux OS**, which allows users to rebuilt their OS, install custom packages, add custom drivers, etc.

As RVC4 can also optionally act as a host computer, it will be able to connect other OAK :ref:`RVC2 <RVC2>`-based cameras to it.
