Robotics Vision Core 2
======================

**Robotics Vision Core 2** (**RVC2** in short) is the second generation of our RVC. :ref:`OAK Series 2` and our initial devices
are built on top of the RVC2.

RVC2 encapsulates two main components:

- **DepthAI features** that are fine-tuned for the particular SoC
- A **performant SoC** and all it's support circuitry (HS PCB layout, power delivery network, efficient heat dissipation, etc.)

Power consumption
*****************

The RVC2 itself has a maximum power consumption of about 4.5W, which is mainly consumed by the SoC, Movidius Myriad X, that
is integrated inside the RVC2.
