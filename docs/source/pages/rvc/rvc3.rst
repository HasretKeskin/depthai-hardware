Robotics Vision Core 3
======================

**Robotics Vision Core 3** (**RVC3** in short) is the third generation of our RVC. :ref:`OAK Series 3` devices are built on top of the RVC3.

RVC3 encapsulates three main components:

- **DepthAI features** that are fine-tuned for the particular SoC
- A **performant SoC** and all its support circuitry (HS PCB layout, power delivery network, efficient heat dissipation, etc.)
- Out-of-the-box **connectivity with Robothub**, our cloud platform, which allows for an end-to-end integration of the perception stack.

Power consumption
*****************

The RVC3 itself has a maximum power consumption of about 8W, which is mainly consumed by the SoC, Movidius Keem Bay, that
is integrated inside the RVC3.
