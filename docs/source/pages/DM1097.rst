Overview
********

**OAK-D-CM4** is based off of the :ref:`OAK-D-CM3 <bw1097>` and it combines a host (RPi CM4) and the
:ref:`OAK-SoM` to allow for a fully standalone and integrated solution for real-time `Spatial AI <https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/spatial-ai/>`__.

The biggest difference between OAK-D-CM4 and :ref:`OAK-D-CM3 <bw1097>` architecture is that OAK-D-CM4 integrates a CM4 module,
has gigabit ethernet, and is populated with MagJack supporting PoE. PoE can be used with additional PoE Hat. CM4 modules also have WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity.

Most OAK-D-CM4 devices have eMMC memory on-board. If you would like to flash a new image to it, follow
the :ref:`tutorial here <Flashing an image to the eMMC>`. :ref:`OAK-SoM` is connected to the RPi CM4 via USB2 lines (on PCB).
