Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC-6P** baseboard has **6 FFC interfaces** which allows for **six 2-lane MIPI** camera modules. It is the
first device from :ref:`OAK Series 3` (with RVP3) and uses the :ref:`dm3399`.

To see **which cameras are compatible with this OAK FFC baseboard**, see the guide here: :ref:`OAK FFC camera modules`.
Some of camera modules have a :ref:`M12 mount <M12 mount lenses>`, so you can use different lenses to get **custom FoV** (with :ref:`wide or narrow FOV M12 lenses <M12 selectable FOV>`).

This board is also compatible with RPi camera interface. For that you will need a `FFC from Arducam <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-12mp-imx477-mini-high-quality-camera-with-m12-mount-lens-and-adapter-board-for-depthai/>`__,
which converts 26-pin Luxonis camera pinout to 22 pin RPi camera pinout.

In addition, IMU (over SPI) sensor is also added to this OAK FFC board.

Getting started
***************

The OAK-FFC-6P accepts 5V (+/-10%) from a 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack, and interfaces to a host via USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C.
With cameras and the :ref:`dm3399`, total power consumption usually stays below the 1.5 A specification, Type-C power
of 1.5 A or greater is recommended.

Interfacing with the :ref:`dm3399` is also possible with OAK-FFC-6P connector pads QSPI, and AUX. These pads
are designed for the Amphenol/FCI 20021121-00010T1LF or equivalent. Please refer to the schematics for pinout
information.

The reset button soft resets the Luxonis DepthAI SoM only, SYS-RST button resets the power system of the DepthAI
and PWR button is a GPIO button that can be used to turn off/on the SoM. BOOT button is meant to be used only for
recovery purposes changing GPIO boot mode to eMMC recovery when the button is held on system power up.

The PG LED indicates 5V power is present and all outputs of the DC-DC converters are inside the specified nominal
voltages. The LED1 indicates "BOOT" status of the DepthAI SoM. The LED2 is an "CONNECT" status LED which indicates
that the OAK-SoM-Max is connected to the network/device.

FFC cables
**********

For FFC cables we use `Molex series 15166 <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/partSearch?query=15166>`__. Along with the OAK FFC board, we ship
**26 pin count, same-sided, 152mm** cables (part number `151660281 <https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/cable/0151660281>`__).
If you would like to use **shorter/longer FFC cables**, you can get them `here <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/deepSearch?pQuery=q%253D*%253A*%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dproductseries%253A%252215166%2522%252BOR%252Bengineeringnumber%253A%252215166%2522%2540fq%253Dcategory%253A%2522Cable%2522%2540fq%253Dcircuitsloaded%253A%252226%2522&currentQuery=contactlayouttype%3AA%2B%2528same%2Bside%2529&origin=_l1stv13w>`__.
