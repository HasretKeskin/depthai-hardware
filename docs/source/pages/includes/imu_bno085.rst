Integrated IMU
**************

This OAK camera has an integrated **BNO085, a 9-axis IMU** (Inertial Measurement Unit). See `IMU node <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/imu/>`__
for the API details on how to use it.

**Note:** due to supply chain issues, most of the OAK camera that were manufactured between Q2 2021 and Q2 2023 have integrated BMI270 - 6-axis IMU instead.
