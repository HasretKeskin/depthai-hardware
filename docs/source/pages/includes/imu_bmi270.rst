Integrated IMU
**************

This OAK camera has an integrated **BMI270, a 6-axis IMU** (Inertial Measurement Unit). See `IMU node <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/imu/>`__
for the API details on how to use it.

**Note:** due to cost reduction efforts, all OAK-D-Lite cameras backed on Kickstarter do not have IMU on board.
