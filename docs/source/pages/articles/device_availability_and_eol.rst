Device availability and EOL
===========================

We **never** EOL (End of Life) products. We have the same culture as
`Mini Circuits <https://www.minicircuits.com/quality/product_change_management.html>`__ -
who is the most respected RF component manufacturer in the world, because they never EOL anything.

How this is accomplished
************************

The way Mini Circuits accomplishes this - and we do the same - is to be constantly releasing
new/better products at a more competitive price point as previous products. This will result in current
products being "outdated".

We realize majority of people will buy the newer, pin-compatible version that is better, faster, cheaper, and generally more efficient.
However, folks that absolutely need the exact version of an old product will still be able to buy it, as we will always offer it.

RVC2-based devices
******************

In 2023, most of our products are :ref:`RVC2 <RVC2>` based, which utilizes Intel's Myriad X VPU. The VPU itself will be in production
at least until 2026, and we will be able to manufacture and sell RVC2-based devices until **2030**. By then, we will have a few new generations
of devices that will be better in all cases, and will be backwards compatible with the RVC2-based software.

Conclusion
**********

Never "EOL-ing" anything has worked extremely well for Mini Circuits for decades and so far great for
us as well. This is why we plan to have availability of all our devices indefinitely.
