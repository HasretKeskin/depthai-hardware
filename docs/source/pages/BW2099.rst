Overview
********

The **OAK-SoM-Pro** is a System on Module (SoM) designed for integration into top-level systems with
a need for a low-power, high performance, real-time AI, and depth perception. It is ideal for use in industrial automation, robotics, and security systems.
The OAK-SoM-Pro interfaces with the system through two 10-Gbps-rated 100-pin board-to-board mezzanine connector which carries
all signal I/O as well as 5v input. The on-board SMPS system regulates the 5V input and provides all necessary digital and analog power.
An auxiliary power port is offered to interface without connection to a baseboard.

**OAK-SoM-Pro comes in two variants**: :ref:`RVC2` based and :ref:`RVC3` based SoM.
:ref:`RVC3` provides ~10x AI performance, quadcore ARM CPU, and enchanced stereo depth perception compared to the :ref:`RVC2`.

OAK-SoM-Pro-S3 (:ref:`RVC3`) was designed to be a drop-in replacement for OAK cameras that use
OAK-SoM-Pro (:ref:`RVC2`) (list below).

        **Devices that use OAK-SoM-Pro MX**

        All devices that have SoM on-board are also open-source. You could redesign them, for example to change stereo baseline. If you
        are interested in integrating DepthAI (via SoM) into your product, see :ref:`documentation here <integrating_depthai_into_products>`.

        **OAK-SoM-Pro-S3** has an :ref:`RVC3` and **quadcore ARM CPU** on board. It was designed to have the same dimensions and pinout as the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro`, so it can easily
        replace the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro` on OAK cameras that use it (:ref:`list here <OAK-SoM-Pro>`).

        It was primarily designed for evaluation and backwards compatibility.
        For new products, we would suggest using :ref:`OAK-SoM-Max` (differences below).
