Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC-OV9282** is a carrier board for the Arducam PY010 OV9282 camera module, and is designed to be compatible with
:ref:`OAK-FFC-3P`, :ref:`OAK-FFC-4P`, and :ref:`OAK-FFC RPi HAT <bw1094>` baseboards. A 26-pin FFC is used
to carry 5V power, 2-lane MIPI, I2C, and other control signals between ththis camera module and the controller baseboard.

People typically use a pair (2) of OAK-FFC-OV9282 to create a stereo camera pair. We previously used Sunny TG161B or AN01V32 OV9282 camera module.

Key features
************

* 26 pin 0.5mm FFC interconnect to baseboard

* 2-lane MIPI
* Aux/Control signals to camera module
* 5V power input via FFC
* On-board power generation for camera module
* Design files produced with Altium Designer 20

Getting started
***************

Camera module compatibility is known for the Arducam PY010 OV9282 and previously used Sunny TG161B and AN01V32,
but not tested for other modules. The FFC interface is an 0.5mm pitch, 26-pin, and bottom-contact connector, across
which travels the 2-lane MIPI, 5V, I2C, camera clock, camera reset, and other optional control lines. 5V power is
regulated down and filtered as appropriate to meet the requirements of the compact camera module and OV9282.
