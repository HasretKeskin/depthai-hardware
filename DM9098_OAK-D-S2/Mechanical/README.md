**Enclosure**:

- [OAK-D S2 STP](https://oak-files.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/OAK-D-S2/DM9098S2_enclosure.stp)
- [OAK-D W STP](https://oak-files.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/OAK-D-S2/DM9098W_enclosure.stp)
- [STL Enclosure for both variants](https://oak-files.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/OAK-D-S2/DM9098S2_enclosure.STL)

**PCBA**
- [STEP PCBA file for both variants](https://oak-files.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/OAK-D-S2/DM9098S2_PCBA.STEP)

OAK-D S2 and OAK-D W are almost identical, except different CCMs and a larger camera hole in the front of the enclosure,
that's why the PCBA and STL files are the same for both versions.
