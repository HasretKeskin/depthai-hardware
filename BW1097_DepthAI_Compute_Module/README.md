# Overview
This repository contains open hardware designed by Luxonis, and meant to be used as a baseboard for the [Luxonis](https://www.luxonis.com/depthai) [OAK-SOM](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1099.html) and the [Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3-plus/). 

Based on the Raspberry PI CMIO board, the BW1097 combines a host and the Luxonis OAK SoM to allow for fully integrated solution for real-time spatial AI.

# Getting started
The BW1097 accepts 5V (+/-10%) from a 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack. Raspberry PI USB boot can be accessed by setting a header jumper, which allows initial flash of eMMC on CM3/CM3+. Alternatively the microSD slot can be used with a bootable system image. The Raspberry PI JTAG header is not populated by default, but can be added, allowing JTAG access. 

The reset button resets the Luxonis OAK SoM only. To reset the CM3/CM3+, ground the `RUN` header via to the `GND` header via.

The PWR LED indicates "power good" for the BW1097 on-board PMIC. The ACT LED indicates activity on the CM3/CM3+ device. Other indicator LEDs exist for the two USB2.0 Type A ports and for the 10/100 Ethernet port.
